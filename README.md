# Introduction

In this project, you will build your own game inspired by _Simon_. Simon is an electronic memory game which uses lights, sounds, and patterns.

The game you will build in this project will only include lights and buttons. The game will begin with the computer flashing one of four coloured LEDs. The player must then push the button which corresponds to the LED the computer lit. When the player does this correctly, the computer will flash the same LED, but this time flash a second random LED after the first. The player must then repeat the LED pattern on the buttons in the correct order. The game continues in this way, with the computer adding a new colour to form a pattern every time the player enters the pattern correctly. The game ends when the player makes a mistake entering the pattern on the buttons.
