# The Circuit

Using your knowledge of electrical circuit components, construct a circuit on your breadboard which connects all four buttons and LEDs to the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. Make sure the buttons and LEDs are placed so that you can tell which button corresponds to each LED. Keep track of which GPIO pins you used, so you can use the right numbers in your code.
